# STEM Swift Academy

## ✍️ App overview

STEM Swift Academy is an online exam preparation app which provides students with well-structured courses and official practice tests. <br><br>
Each student has the opportunity to register for a free course, watch live lectures with a qualified tutor, and revise the material through lecture recordings. During the course, the students have access to practice tests to solidify their knowledge. Whenever they encounter a question they are doubtful about or do not know the answer to, they have the opportunity to add it to their digital notebook, using one of the most efficient study techniques - Kolb's experiential cycle. This way, they will acquire deep understanding of the topics and prevent similar mistakes in the future. <br><br>At the end of each course, they take a final exam to determine their current level. If they have a passing grade (>= 80%), they receive a certificate to verify their participation in the course.<br><br>
They also have access to detailed statistics about their practice test performance, as well as predicted scores for the SAT. They are allowed to view and modify their student data on their profile page.
